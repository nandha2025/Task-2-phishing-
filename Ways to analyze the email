🚩 Major Red Flags

1. Sender address looks fake

“support@secure-verification-center.com” is not a domain used by legitimate companies.

Scammers often use official-sounding but unrelated domains.



2. Threatening language & urgency

“Your account will be suspended in 24 hours” is a classic tactic to make you act without thinking.



3. Suspicious link

http://secure-verify-account.com/login

Legit services use secure, recognizable domains (e.g., the company’s official domain) and always HTTPS.

Phishing links often contain words like “secure,” “verify,” or “account” to appear trustworthy.



4. Generic greeting

“Dear Customer” suggests the sender doesn’t know your name—another common phishing trait.



5. No mention of what account or service

They avoid naming the actual service so they can target anyone.
