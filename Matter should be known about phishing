Phishing is when someone pretends to be a trusted person or company to trick you.
It feels urgent or scary (like “your account will be blocked today”). The email asks for passwords, OTPs, or bank details and has strange links or attachments
They usually send fake emails or messages to steal your passwords, money, or personal details.
You can copy the email header and paste it into free online “email header analyzer” tools. 
Security teams may also use special security or SIEM tools to check headers automatically.
