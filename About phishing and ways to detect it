🧨 What Is Phishing?

Phishing is a cyberattack where criminals pretend to be a trusted company or person to trick you into giving:

Passwords

Credit card numbers

Personal information

Access to your accounts


They usually do this through fake:

Emails

Text messages

Websites

Phone calls

Social media messages


The goal is identity theft, financial theft, or account takeover.

🎣 Common Signs of Phishing

1. Urgency or Threats

“Your account will be suspended in 24 hours.”

“You must act immediately.”


2. Suspicious Sender Address

Strange or unofficial-looking domain names.


3. Generic Greetings

“Dear customer/user” instead of your name.


4. Unexpected Links or Attachments

5. Strange URLs

Misspelled domains

Unrelated domains

Fake “secure” wording


6. Asking for Sensitive Info

Legitimate companies never ask you to confirm passwords by email.

🛡️ How to Protect Yourself From Phishing

✔️ 1. Check the Sender Carefully

Look at the full email address—not just the display name.
If the domain looks odd or unfamiliar, be cautious.


---

✔️ 2. Never Click Unknown Links

Instead:

Visit the official website by typing the URL yourself.

Use bookmarked official pages.



---

✔️ 3. Check for HTTPS

Only enter sensitive information on sites using https:// with a lock icon.
But note: scammers can also use HTTPS, so this is not the only check.


---

✔️ 4. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Even if scammers get your password, MFA can prevent them from logging in.


---

✔️ 5. Keep Devices and Software Updated

Updates patch vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.


---

✔️ 6. Use a Password Manager

It:

Auto-fills passwords only on legitimate websites

Helps you spot fake sites (the manager won’t autofill on them)



---

✔️ 7. Be Skeptical of Urgent Messages

If a message pressures you, assume it might be a scam.


---

✔️ 8. Report Phishing

Depending on where you live, you can report to:

Your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

Your company’s IT/security team

National cybercrime centers



---

✔️ 9. Verify with the Company Directly

If you get a suspicious email from “your bank” or “your account,” contact the company using:

Their official website

Their official customer service number

Their mobile app


Never through the link provided in the message.


---

✔️ 10. Educate Family & Employees

Most people get hacked due to lack of awareness.
Sharing info prevents attacks.
